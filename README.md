> Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for general non-linear dimension reduction. 
> ([original UMAP documentation](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html))

* Ruby Umappp is a wrapper library for [C++ Umappp library](https://github.com/LTLA/umappp) created by Aaron Lun 
* Compatible with [yaumap](https://github.com/LTLA/yaumap)
* Support [Numo::NArray](https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo-narray)

## Installation

```
gem install umappp
```

* [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org) is required for multithreading.

## Usage

This Gem provides the module `Umappp` and its singular method `Umappp.run()`. The first argument of `Umappp.run()` is a two-dimensional Ruby array or a two-dimensional Numo array. [Numo](https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo-narray) is a library for performing N-dimensional array computing like NumPy. The argument is converted to `Numo::SFloat`. SFloat is a single precision floating point number type of Numo::NArray.

```ruby
# The embedding is two-dimensional Ruby array or Numo array
# Returns Numo::SFloat
r = Umappp.run(embedding)

# Run with parameters
r = Umappp.run(pixels, num_threads: 8, a: 1.8956, b: 0.8006)
```

### Umappp dependencies

This Gem is a wrapper for [Umappp](https://github.com/LTLA/umappp). We store and distribute Umappp and other dependent C++ code in the Vendor directory. Umappp is compiled when the Gem is installed. Umappp's C++ modules have complex dependencies as shown in the figure below. It is not a good idea to manage them manually. Use `script/vendor.sh` to update them automatically. This actually runs cmake and moves the required directories to the vendor directory.
